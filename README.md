# Web Maps
This repository is used as a server to host our web maps.

We can visit the web maps at, for example, https://pengdlzn.github.io/webmaps/2020/10/merge/top10nl-0.1.html.

By default, the websites in branch 'gh-pages' will be published (see https://pages.github.com). I have explicitly switched to show the websites in branch 'master'.
